          Can't Hurt Me is a memoir by David Goggins, chronicling his journey from a troubled childhood to becoming one of the toughest endurance athletes and elite Navy SEALs in history. Goggins shares his life story, marked by abuse, poverty, and self-doubt, and how he transformed his mindset to overcome physical, mental, and emotional barriers.

          In the book, Goggins introduces the concept of "The 40% Rule," which suggests that when most people think they've reached their limit, they're actually only at 40% of their true potential. He offers actionable advice on building mental toughness, developing resilience, and pushing beyond perceived limits.
          
          The book combines autobiography with self-help principles, encouraging readers to embrace discomfort, confront their fears, and pursue their goals with relentless effort. Through personal anecdotes, extreme fitness challenges, and a no-excuses attitude, Goggins provides a roadmap for anyone looking to unlock their full potential and live a more purposeful life.
