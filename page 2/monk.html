          The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari by Robin Sharma is a motivational fable that tells the story of Julian Mantle, a high-powered lawyer who experiences a spiritual transformation after a life crisis. He sells his material possessions, including his Ferrari, and embarks on a journey to the Himalayan mountains, where he learns timeless lessons on self-mastery, purpose, and fulfillment from a group of enlightened monks.

          Through the narrative, Sharma introduces practical wisdom and actionable steps to help readers live a more balanced, meaningful, and joyful life. The book emphasizes the importance of pursuing oneâ€™s inner purpose, practicing mindfulness, and nurturing personal growth.
