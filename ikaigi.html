        <p id="desc"><span>About : </span>
          Ikigai by Héctor García and Francesc Miralles explores the Japanese concept of Ikigai, which translates to "reason for being." The book delves into how the people of Okinawa, known for their longevity, find purpose and happiness by following their ikigai—a sense of purpose that gives life meaning and fulfillment.

          The authors blend research with insights from interviews with Okinawan centenarians, revealing how a balanced lifestyle, strong community connections, and mindful living contribute to health and happiness. The book serves as a guide for readers to discover their own ikigai, emphasizing the importance of living with intention and finding joy in everyday activities
